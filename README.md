# SQL Exercises Repository

Welcome to the SQL repository! This collection of SQL queries aims to guide learners through fundamental and advanced SQL concepts, organized by key topics like data selection, joins, aggregation, subqueries, PL/SQL, and more.

## Overview

This repository is designed to build a strong foundation in SQL by solving real-world problems and covering diverse SQL topics. These exercises involves data querying, manipulation, and advanced SQL functions.

## Categories & Descriptions

Here are the key topics covered in this repository, with the SQL files grouped accordingly:
### 1. Data Selection & Filtering

  - Description:
    - Focus on fundamental SQL operations like SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY, allowing you to filter, retrieve, and sort data from database tables.

### 2. Aggregation & Grouping

  - Description:
    - Usage of SQL’s powerful aggregation functions like SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT(). This category also covers GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to group and filter aggregated data.

### 3. Joins & Relationships

  - Description:
    - Combining data from multiple tables using various types of JOIN operations (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN). This section explores how to establish relationships between tables in a relational database.

### 4. Subqueries & Set Operations

  - Description:
    - This category covers more advanced SQL techniques, such as subqueries (nested queries) and set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT. Also about how to break down complex data retrieval processes into manageable sub-tasks.

### 5. Window Functions

  - Description:
    - Using window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), NTILE()) to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Useful for ranking, moving averages, and partitioning data.

### 6. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

  - Description:
    - Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure complex queries. CTEs provide a cleaner way to write recursive and non-recursive queries, improving readability and performance.

### 7. PL/SQL Procedures

  - Description:
    - Explore the procedural extension of SQL in Oracle’s PL/SQL language. This section includes exercises on writing stored procedures, triggers, and handling exceptions, adding logic and control to SQL execution.

## Key Learning Areas

  - Data Selection: Querying data using basic SELECT and filtering conditions.
  - Joins & Relationships: Combine data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.
  - Subqueries & Set Operations: Advanced query techniques for complex data retrieval.
  - Aggregation: SQL functions to summarize and analyze large datasets.
  - Window Functions & CTEs: Advanced SQL functionality to process, rank, and partition data.
  - PL/SQL: Procedural SQL with stored procedures and triggers for Oracle databases.
